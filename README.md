- 👋 Hi, I’m @marblewraith
- 👀 Interested in: Pretty much anything with a technology basis, but with a greater focus on stuff that pertains to the web, scaled solutions.
- 🌱 Learning: Mostly the fuzz surrounding contributing to open source. There are some extra bits that make public repos' a little different to private ones.
- 💞️ Collaborate on: Nothing at the moment, i have quite a few projects on my backlog, but you're welcome to follow me.
- 📫 Contact via: Twitter is probably easiest. The next best being Email.
